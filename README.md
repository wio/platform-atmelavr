# ATMEL AVR Wio Platform

ATMEL AVR 8-bit and 32-bit AVRÂ® microcontrollers (MCUs) are an excellent choice for designers of a wide variety of embedded systems.  These devices offer a unique combination of performance, power efficiency and design flexibility. Optimized to reduce development time, they are based on the industry's most code-efficient architecture for C and assembly programming. Read more about them on [their website](http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/8-bit/avr-mcus).
